Utility Classes 


**********************************************************************
1. Introduction

Utility classes are what would formally have gone into our "lib" folder
in mia / the old modules. They are classes which perform tasks within a specific
domain, such as retrieving and working with files from the filesystem or storing
information.

Generally, utility classes will be the "last place you turn" when deciding
where to put a piece of functionality, but as a general rule consider the 
following definition:

"a utility class is a class that defines a set of methods that perform common, often re-used functions"

The other general rule is, if you're thinking of putting something in the "lib" 
folder then you should probably put it in the "utility" folder instead.

2. Implementation

* Anything goes in a utility class, just put them in the "utility" folder and 
  they're ready to use.

* Make sure it's really obvious, even from the name, what the class does

* Comment the class well so others find/use it
