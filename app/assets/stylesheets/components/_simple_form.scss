// This is likely a stop-gap measure until the UI is revisited.  At that point
// I would imagine we will be using an up-to-date CSS framework such as
// Bootstrap 5.  If that's the case, all of the simple_form generated forms can
// be updated to Bootstrap styled forms by following
// https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form/#bootstrap-5
//
// If a different CSS framework is used, there may already be a suitable
// simple_form integration.
form.simple_form {
    // We have this here for consistency with the other concertim forms.  We
    // really ought to be using some other method.
    width: 450px;

    .field_with_hint input {
        margin-bottom: 0;
    }

    // Styling for the fields with a clipboard button added.  This is very
    // quick and dirty and I'd expect a refresh of the UI to use a CSS
    // framwork that support this such as
    // https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/input-group/#button-addons.
    // But for now this will do.
