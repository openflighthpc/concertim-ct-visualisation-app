# Utility Classes

## Introduction

Utility classes perform tasks within a specific domain, such as retrieving and
working with files from the filesystem or making HTTP requests.

Generally, utility classes will be the "last place you turn" when deciding
where to put a piece of functionality, but as a general rule consider the
following definition:

"a utility class is a class that defines a set of methods that perform common, often re-used functions"

## Implementation

* Anything goes in a utility class, just put them in the "utility" folder and
  they're ready to use.

* Make sure it's really obvious, even from the name, what the class does

* Comment the class well so others find/use it
